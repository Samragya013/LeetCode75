ðŸ§µ Merge Strings Alternately
Category: Two Pointers

What I Learned: Practiced merging two strings by alternating characters using a clean, loop-based logic.

Key Skill: Iterating in parallel through two strings.

Code:
    
char * mergeAlternately(char * word1, char * word2){
    int len1 = strlen(word1), len2 = strlen(word2);
    char* result = malloc(len1 + len2 + 1);
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
    while (i < len1 || j < len2) {
        if (i < len1) 
            result[k++] = word1[i++];
        if (j < len2)
             result[k++] = word2[j++];
    }
    result[k] = '\0';
    return result;
}
